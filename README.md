# RING2parser
Parser for Protein analyzer RING 2.0 (University of Padua http://protein.bio.unipd.it/ring/) with basic graph measurements such as __shortest paths__ on the graph, __betweenness centrality__ and __closeness centrality__.

## Disclamer
This project was made during bioinformatics class at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.
We tried to keep it clean and modular but it's not really ready-to-use and it requires a minimum knowledge about python.

## Instructions
You can launch this project in two ways:

1. Open this project in pycharm and simply launch the __\__main\__.py__ file (in the root directory of the project). 
Remember to fill variables in the beginning of  this file according to what you want to analyze (file / interaction), and in case of errors you can also try to adjust __cache__ and __output__ directories in __/src/graphs_parser/\__int\__.py__

2. Launch this from terminal:
    * arg[1] = position of the xml* file that represents the graph
    * arg[2] = type of interaction.
        This variable can assume different values like: __ALL__ (that analyze all the interactions together combining them) or __HBOND__, __IONIC__ and other types of interections (if they're present in the graph)


*The xml file must be the output computed from http://protein.bio.unipd.it/ring/ (you can find some of these files in __assets/__ folder)
